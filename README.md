TempTerminator Revision 1.0



What it does:
- Safely cleans your Windows TEMP folder.
- Deletes temporary files and folders that are not in use.
- Skips files or folders that cannot be deleted (e.g., in use or protected).
- Logs all operations in TempTerminator_Log.txt (created next to the EXE).
- If the program crashes, a Crashlog.txt is created on your Desktop.

Notes:
- Files in use cannot be deleted and will be safely skipped.
- No files outside the TEMP folder will be touched.
- The program is safe to run and will not harm your system.

What is TEMP and why it should be deleted:
- The TEMP folder stores temporary files created by Windows and applications.
- These files accumulate over time and can take up gigabytes of space.
- Old or unused temporary files can slow down your computer or cause software conflicts.
- Cleaning the TEMP folder helps free disk space and can improve system performance
